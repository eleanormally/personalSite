    <small>A web-based IDE for embedded programming, and first lessons in building for someone else.</small>
    <h2>The Premise</h2>
    <p>Back in high school, I took an introductory robotics class. Now, I'm sure some people reading this 
    has something of a similar experience, perhaps with arduino's or even some block based programming language. Unfortunately,
    my school had a collection of boards build on the <a href="https://www.parallax.com/product/basic-stamp-2-microcontroller-module/">Parallax BS2</a>, 
    a surprisingly capable device with one major flaw: programming it. To write programs for this device, we used the Parallax IDE, available as a Chrome App. 
    If you've heard of Chrome Apps before, you may know that they were sunsetted a number of years ago. This was set to happen just as I was finishing that robotics course.
    </p>
    <p>
    Despite the looming dissapearance of the one tool that allowed students to write and build code for these boards (besides a falling-apart native app that we couldn't run on our school-provided chromebooks),
    I was by no means mourning the loss of this product. It was bug ridden, its UI needed some serious work, and for gods sake it was a <i>Chrome App</i>. Something new needed to take its place.
    </p>
    <h2>The Name</h2>
    <p>
    First, I should mention the name. It began when I tried to fix some of my problems with the Parallax IDE. Luckily, the IDE is <a href="https://github.com/parallaxinc/Parallax-IDE">open source</a>, and since a Chrome App is largely a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/What_is_a_progressive_web_app">PWA</a>,
    it was simple enough to hack on. I tried to fix a number of problems I had with the UI, and dubbed the slightly improved version "Perpendicullax". I used this for a month or two in that robotics class,
    and I thought the successor would need to continue the angle name series. Thus, Skewax.
