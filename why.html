  <h1>Why does this website look like this?</h1>
  <p>
    This website is made with minimal, if any, css, and relies almost entirely on hand written html. There are no fonts, there is no javascript, there is just webpage. 
    I work on a browser; I see a lot of fancy websites in my day to day, and I also have to make sure those fancy websites don't break things. Therefore, my website
    is as simple as I can make it.

    Also, I think its a little silly, and potentially even somewhat goofy.
